<Caption>The particle system editor.</Caption>

A particle system and editor I was working on.

Neat but not performant enough.
At high particle counts the kind of OOPish code I wrote it with doesn't work well.
To get it to work well with thousands of particles the code would have to be re-implemented in shaders.
