**Disclaimer: I'm new to Svelte so this isn't so much a recommendation as it is a "I guess this is a way to do it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è".**

I've been playing around with Svelte lately, trying to port some React code to it as an experiment.

A challenge I came across is that I could not find a Svelte equivalent of `useEffect`.

Svelte has support for turning a listener based API into a custom store that can also be reactive.
This replaces some usages of `useEffect`.

However, for cases where we want to perform reactive effects that only trigger side effects I was unsure how to port the code to Svelte.

**The React code to port**:

You can see that when the track instance is swapped we remove the listener on the previous track, and add one on the new track.

<Playground>


```html filename=index.html
<div id="root" />
```

```js filename=index.js main
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ow from 'oceanwind'
import { App } from './App.js'

document.body.className = ow`m-4`

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

```js filename=App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import ow from 'oceanwind'
import { Track } from './Track.js'

const appendChild = document.body.appendChild.bind(document.body)
const addText = (text) => appendChild(document.createTextNode(text))
const addBreak = () => appendChild(document.createElement('br'))

const createTrack = () => ({
  on(event) {
    addText(`Added listener on: ${event}`)
    addBreak()
  },
  off(event) {
    addText(`Removed listener on: ${event}`)
    addBreak()
  },
})

export const App = () => {
  const [track, setTrack] = useState(createTrack())
  const switchTrack = () => setTrack(createTrack())
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        className={ow`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`}
        onClick={switchTrack}
      >
        Switch Track
      </button>
      <Track track={track} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename=Track.js selected
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

export const Track = ({ track }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    let onStop = () => track.stopAllTracks()
    track.on('stop', onStop)
    return () => {
      track.off('stop', onStop)
    }
  }, [track])
  return null
}
```

</Playground>


The behavior we want is:

- We want to add a listener to the `stop` event on `track`.
- That listener will call a `stopAllTracks()` method on the track (don't think too hard about it, it's just an example of some kind of side effect).
- When the component is unmounted we will remove the listener on the track.
- When the `track` prop changes (replaced with a new track) we remove the listener from the previous track and add one on the new track.
  - This is very important, otherwise our component would be in an invalid state with respect to its props.
  - Not handling the track prop changing could be considered a bug, and it could be difficult to diagnose.
  - Hooks are intended to help prevent this sort of bug in React.
  - You can read about this in [Dan Abramov's article, React as a UI Runtime](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/) and in [Writing Resilient Components](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/).

This is what I've come up with for Svelte (please let me know if you know a better way):

The implementation of `useEffect` is very simple:

```js
const useEffect = (subscribe) => ({ subscribe })
```

Our `useEffect` function returns a custom store. Stores in Svelte should implement a `subscribe` method.
The `subscribe` method is passed an `onChange` function to alert Svelte about new data, and it can return a cleanup function.
Since we're only interested in side effects we don't use the `onChange` function in our use case.

Svelte has support for creating stores reactively. Svelte also has support for auto subscribing to a store using `$`.

So we can use this custom store creating function like so:

<Playground>


```html filename=index.html
<div id="root" />
```

```js filename=index.js main
import App from './App.svelte'
import ow from 'oceanwind'

document.body.className = ow`m-4`

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById('root'),
})
```

```svelte filename=App.svelte
<script>
  import Track from './Track.svelte'
  import ow from 'oceanwind'

  const appendChild = document.body.appendChild.bind(document.body)
  const addText = (text) => appendChild(document.createTextNode(text))
  const addBreak = () => appendChild(document.createElement('br'))

  const createTrack = () => ({
    on(event) {
      addText(`Added listener on: ${event}`)
      addBreak()
    },
    off(event) {
      addText(`Removed listener on: ${event}`)
      addBreak()
    },
  })

  let track = createTrack()

  const switchTrack = () => {
    track = createTrack()
  }
</script>

<div>
  <button
    class={ow`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`}
    on:click={switchTrack}
  >
    Switch Track
  </button>
  <Track {track} />
</div>
```

```js filename=useEffect.js
export const useEffect = (subscribe) => ({ subscribe })
```

```svelte filename=Track.svelte selected
<script>
  import { useEffect } from './useEffect.js'

  export let track

  let effect
  $: effect = useEffect(() => {
    const onStop = () => track.stopAll()
    track.on('stop', onStop)
    return () => {
      track.off('stop', onStop)
    }
  })
  $: $effect
</script>

```

</Playground>


`effect` is assigned using a reactive declaration, so a new store is created whenever `track` is changed.
The Svelte compiler does the dependency tracking work for us, so there's no dependency array like in React.
Using another reactive statement with `$effect` we have Svelte automatically handle subscribing and unsubscribing to the store, without this statement the store will not do anything.
With this we have replicated the most important behaviors of `useEffect`.

This implementation isn't too bad compared to the React version.
I'd still be interested in Svelte making things easier so I've opened a feature request for [Reactive statement cleanup functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5283).
