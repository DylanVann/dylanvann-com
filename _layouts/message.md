I just submitted my first link to HN. It was a bit of a bust, haha. I do feel better that it looks like 99% of links just drop down the new page without any attention.

Goals for the project:

- Object oriented.
- Well designed interfaces (class interfaces).
- Comprehensive auto generated docs.
- Interesting UI.

The problem is if I moved the simulation code into shaders it throws the first three goals out the window, so it would be cool, but it wouldn't meet the goals I had for the project.
