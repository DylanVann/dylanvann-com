<p class="caption">The particle system editor.</p>

This project is... ongoing.

It was supposed to be a particle engine using canvas and javascript.

At the moment it works, but it can't handle enough particles.

The rendering code needs to be changed to WebGL. The particle simulation code needs to be moved into shaders. This will end up making the code fast enough, but much less elegant, so that's unfortunate.
